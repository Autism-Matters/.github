## Hi there 👋

This is the GitHub Organisation for [Autism Matters](https://autism-matters.co.uk). We are an established “not for profit” charitable incorporated organisation(CIO), based in the North East of England, offering a range of support and services for Autistic adults designed by Autistic adults.

We don't have any Open Source projects but behind the scenes, we're cooking up some magic to ensure our members can work with us more easily and effective than ever before. We do, however, have some blog posts which highlight what it is we do and how you can get involved:
